# Relationship Types

> The 26 typed edges that connect domain concepts into a navigable knowledge graph — 12 backend, 8 intra-UI, and 6 cross-layer.

## Overview

Every concept in the system connects to other concepts through typed relationships. These edges make the knowledge graph navigable — from any concept, you can follow edges to understand what it touches.

## Cross-Layer Edge Details

### `fetches` — Binding → Query

A UI binding fetches data from a backend query via an API endpoint.

_In the registry:_ Traces UI actions to backend state changes. Follow this edge to answer "What domain operation does {Hook} trigger?"

### `reflects` — State Indicator → State Machine

A UI state indicator visually mirrors a backend state machine value.

> PlayerStatusBadge **reflects** PlayerStatus (OBSERVATION=blue, ACTIVE=green, INACTIVE=gray)

A form's Zod schema is the client-side contract for a backend interface endpoint. Changes to the interface must be reflected in the form schema.

> CreatePlayerForm **contracts** POST /players (PlayerAPI.createPlayer)
> SettlementForm **contracts** GET /settlements/preview + POST /settlements

_In the registry:_ Shows schema alignment obligations. Follow this edge to answer "Which form breaks if {Interface} endpoint changes?"

> AdminGuard **mirrors** AdminRoleRule (role === 'admin')

_In the registry:_ Shows where frontend and backend access logic must stay in sync. Follow this edge to answer "What server rule does {Guard} duplicate?"

## Navigating the Graph

The edges form navigation paths that mirror how humans think about a system:

### Backend Navigation

**"What does this feature do?"**
→ Start at Entity → follow `performs` → find Operations → follow `produces` → see Events

**"What happens when a payment is processed?"**
→ ProcessPayment → `enforces` (see Rules) → `calculates` (see Calculations) → `produces` PaymentInitiated → `transitions` PaymentStatus

**"What consumes this event?"**
→ PaymentCompleted → look at event consumers → follow to downstream features

**"How do I call this operation?"**
→ ProcessPayment → follow `exposes` backward → find PaymentAPI → see endpoint details

**"What data does this API return?"**
→ GET /payments → `exposes` GetPaymentStatus → `queries` PaymentTransaction → `maps` TransactionToResponse

### UI Navigation

**"What does this page show?"**
→ Start at Page → follow `renders` → find Components → follow `consumes` → find Hooks → follow `fetches` → arrive at backend Query

**"What happens when the user submits this form?"**
→ CreatePlayerForm → `submits` useCreatePlayer() → `mutates` CreatePlayer (Operation) → `produces` PlayerCreated (Event) → `transitions` PlayerStatus

**"Where does the data on this table come from?"**
→ PlayersTable → `consumes` usePlayers() → `fetches` GetAllPlayers (Query) → `queries` Player (Entity)

**"What breaks if I change this API endpoint?"**
→ Interface endpoint → follow `contracts` backward → find Forms with aligned schemas
→ Interface endpoint → follow `fetches` backward → find Hooks with bindings

**"How does domain state appear on screen?"**
→ PlayerStatus (State Machine) → follow `reflects` backward → find PlayerStatusBadge (State Indicator) → see color mapping

### Full-Stack Trace (End to End)

**"Trace a user creating a player from click to database"**

```
/players/new (Page)
  → renders CreatePlayerForm (Component / Form)
    → submits useCreatePlayer() (Hook / Binding)
      → mutates CreatePlayer (Operation) via POST /players (Interface)
        → enforces [NameRequiredRule, EmailUniqueRule] (Rules)
        → produces PlayerCreated (Event)
          → transitions PlayerStatus: → OBSERVATION (State Machine)
```

**"Trace settlement data from database to screen"**

```
Player + MakeupPolicy + Stats (Entities)
  → queries GetSettlementPreview (Query)
    → exposes GET /settlements/preview (Interface)
      → fetches useSettlementPreview() (Hook / Binding)
        → shapes SettlementPreview (Adapter → View Model)
          → displays SettlementPreviewCard (Component)
            → renders /settlements (Page)
```

## Registry Format

In `registry.md`, the concept graph lists all edges as a flat table:

```markdown
## Concept Graph

| From                       | Edge     | To                       |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| payment.PaymentTransaction | contains | shared.Money             |
| payment.ProcessPayment     | produces | payment.PaymentInitiated |
| payment.MaxAmountRule      | enforces | payment.ProcessPayment   |
| payment.PaymentAPI         | exposes  | payment.ProcessPayment   |
```

### UI Concept Graph (same table, ui-prefixed IDs)

```markdown
| From                                   | Edge      | To                                |
| -------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| ui.player-management./players          | renders   | ui.player-management.PlayersTable |
| ui.player-management.PlayersTable      | consumes  | ui.player-management.usePlayers   |
| ui.player-management.usePlayers        | fetches   | player-management.GetAllPlayers   |
| ui.player-management.CreatePlayerForm  | contracts | player-management.PlayerAPI       |
| ui.player-management.PlayerStatusBadge | reflects  | player-management.PlayerStatus    |
| ui.DashboardLayout                     | wraps     | ui.player-management./players     |
```

Backend concepts use `{feature}.{Concept}` IDs. UI concepts use `ui.{feature}.{Concept}` IDs. Shared UI concepts (layouts, guards) use `ui.{Concept}` without a feature prefix.
