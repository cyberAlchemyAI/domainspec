# Arcanum Sigil: spellcraft

<!-- arcanum:capability-id spellcraft -->
<!-- arcanum:capability-kind sigil -->
<!-- arcanum:capability-tier arcana -->
<!-- arcanum:command spellcraft -->

<!-- arcanum:runtime codex -->

## Observer Envelope: Task Zero

Before doing domain work, establish the observer envelope for this Arcanum invocation.

- `run_id`: use an existing hook-provided run id when present; otherwise use `arcanum-spellcraft-<UTC timestamp>`.
- `capability.id`: `spellcraft`
- `capability.kind`: `sigil`
- `capability.tier`: `arcana`
- `capability.mode`: `command`
- `target_artifact`: this command file
- request summary: summarize the user request before execution.
- expected outputs: list intended artifacts before execution when known.

Closeout is mandatory but must not hide the primary result. At the end, report:

- `OBSERVATION`
- `LEDGER`
- `REFLECTION_TRIGGER`
- `RECOMMENDATION`
- `DEDUPE_KEY`

If deterministic hook or wrapper telemetry is unavailable, preserve the result and report the observability gap.


## Objective

Run the installed Arcanum sigil `spellcraft` using the canonical definition snapshot embedded below.

## Process

1. Use the embedded canonical README and SKILL snapshots as the execution contract.
2. Execute only this installed sigil unless the definition explicitly delegates or the user asks to route elsewhere.
3. Preserve the selected sigil's process, quality bar, anti-patterns, output contract, validation gates, gaps, and next route.
4. Return artifact used, command used, validation result, observability result, and next action.

## Guardrails

- Keep this command focused on `spellcraft`.
- Do not silently add, remove, or refresh capabilities.
- Do not treat generated observer telemetry as a substitute for the primary result.

# Spellcraft

Spellcraft is an Arcana sigil for designing, installing, validating, observing, and revising spells.

It helps users combine existing sigils into localized workflows without copying or mutating the sigils themselves. A spell defines orchestration: phases, shared state, gates, handoffs, failure policy, local customization, and observability.

Spellcraft also manages spell aliases. A spell keeps a stable canonical ID for filenames and automation, while users can invoke it through memorable aliases such as `Repository Codex`. The name `Necronomicon` is reserved for the persistent repository harness.

Spellcraft is the lifecycle owner for spell artifacts. It may consume handoff packets produced by [Invoke](../../spells/invoke/), but Invoke does not replace spell lifecycle design, installation, validation, observation, or reflection.

## Problem It Solves

Some work is best handled by multiple sigils together. Users should not have to remember the right sequence every time, and individual sigils should not grow extra responsibilities just to support a common workflow.

Spellcraft solves this by creating explicit spell contracts that compose sigils by reference.

## Use When

- several sigils should run together in a repeatable workflow,
- a repository needs a local spell under `.arcanum/spells/`,
- a user wants to adapt a library spell to local paths and policies,
- continuing from an Invoke handoff that targets spell creation or revision,
- outputs from one sigil should become inputs to another,
- a spell needs validation, observability, or revision.

## Do Not Use When

- one sigil already handles the task,
- the composition is a one-off experiment,
- the workflow has no handoff artifacts or gates,
- the spell would copy sigil internals instead of referencing them,
- the user needs immediate execution rather than a reusable local workflow.

## Chain Position

Spellcraft sits after Invoke and before execution:

```text
invoke handoff -> spellcraft lifecycle work -> task-session for approved implementation tasks
```

Responsibilities:

- Invoke owns discovery, authoring baseline, and handoff artifacts.
- Spellcraft owns spell composition, phase/gate design, local installation/adaptation, validation, observability, reflection, and revision.
- Sigil Development owns changes to individual sigil contracts referenced by the spell.
- Task Session owns bounded execution of approved work-pack tasks or SWUs.
- Experiment Harness owns repeatable test mechanics, live Codex examples, validation reports, and telemetry emission for reusable spells.

If a referenced sigil needs to change, Spellcraft should route that work to Sigil Development instead of redefining the sigil internally.

## Codex Goal And Experiment Closure

When spell implementation or local adaptation work uses Codex native Goals, close the loop through both Task Session and Experiment Harness:

```text
spellcraft owns lifecycle work-pack
  -> task-session selects one ready task/SWU
  -> codex-goal adapter creates native /goal
  -> Codex executes the bounded runtime goal
  -> task-session reviews evidence and syncs the work-pack
  -> experiment-harness validates reusable spell behavior
  -> spellcraft consumes validation, telemetry, and reflection signals
```

Codex Goal evidence can prove that one bounded implementation or adaptation unit completed. It does not replace spell experiments. A reusable spell is not promotion-ready until experiment evidence checks realistic prompts, phase outputs, gates, handoffs, Quality Bar, Anti-Patterns, and observability.

For spell lifecycle proof, initialize the harness with the Spellcraft profile:

```bash
arcana/experiment-harness/scripts/init-harness.sh <spell-path> --type spell --profile spellcraft
```

This keeps Experiment Harness responsible for mechanics while Spellcraft remains responsible for spell lifecycle judgment.

## Default Output

Repository-local spells should live at:

```text
.arcanum/spells/<spell-name>/README.md
```

Reusable library spells live in [spells](../../spells/).

## Alias Rules

- Canonical IDs are stable and use kebab-case.
- Aliases are human-facing names that resolve to canonical IDs.
- Alias lookup is case-insensitive.
- An alias must resolve to exactly one active spell.
- Local repositories may add local aliases without changing upstream spell contracts.
- Spell run reports should record both the alias used and the canonical ID.

## Why This Is Arcana

Spellcraft coordinates workflow design, local repository adaptation, sigil compatibility checks, gate design, observability, and lifecycle maintenance across multiple sigils.

# Sigil: Spellcraft

<objective>
Create and maintain spell compositions that reference multiple sigils, define coherent execution phases, and preserve shared state, gates, handoffs, and observability.
</objective>

<logic-type>
Arcana: cross-sigil workflow composition, local adaptation, validation, and lifecycle governance.
</logic-type>

<modes>
- `design`: create a new spell from a user goal and available sigils.
- `install`: adapt a library spell into a repository-local spell file.
- `run-plan`: produce an execution plan for a spell without running all phases.
- `validate`: check spell structure, references, gates, and handoffs.
- `observe`: record spell-level telemetry after execution.
- `reflect`: improve a spell from accumulated telemetry or user feedback.
</modes>

<chain-boundary>
Spellcraft is the lifecycle owner for spell artifacts.

- `invoke` owns early discovery, definition, design, planning, and handoff packets.
- `spellcraft` owns spell composition, phase/gate design, local installation/adaptation, validation, observability, reflection, and revision.
- `sigil-development` owns changes to individual sigil contracts referenced by a spell.
- `task-session` owns bounded execution from approved work-pack tasks or SWUs.
- `experiment-harness` owns repeatable test mechanics, realistic prompts, live Codex examples, validation reports, and telemetry emission for reusable spells.

When the input is an Invoke handoff, consume the handoff as source context, then take lifecycle ownership of the spell. Do not send the user back to Invoke unless the handoff is missing the workflow objective, target repository scope, or intended output artifact.
</chain-boundary>

<codex-goal-closure-loop>
Codex Goal is a runtime execution lane, not a validation substitute.

When implementation or adaptation work is delegated through Task Session and the `codex-goal` adapter:

1. Spellcraft owns the lifecycle work-pack and promotion decision.
2. Task Session selects one ready task/SWU and checks gates.
3. The Codex Goal adapter generates or hands off one native `/goal`.
4. Codex executes the bounded runtime goal.
5. Task Session reviews the result against the original task/SWU and syncs work-pack evidence.
6. Experiment Harness runs or validates the artifact-local examples/regimes.
7. Spellcraft consumes the experiment report, observability signal, and reflection trigger state before marking lifecycle progress.

Required runtime evidence shape:

```yaml
runtime: codex
adapter: codex-goal
source_swu: <id>
result: pass | flag | block | interrupted
files_touched:
  - <path>
validation:
  - <command or review evidence>
experiment_harness:
  status: pass | flag | block | not_run
  report: <path or none>
remaining_blockers:
  - <blocker or none>
lifecycle_owner_next_step: validate | observe | reflect | iterate | promote
```

A spell implementation or adaptation SWU is not lifecycle-complete until runtime evidence is reviewed and the relevant experiment harness state is updated or explicitly blocked.

<default-output>
For repository-local spells, write to:

```text
.arcanum/spells/<spell-name>/README.md
```

For reusable library spells, write to:

```text
spells/<spell-name>/README.md
```
</default-output>

<process>
1. Resolve mode, target repository, spell name, and whether the spell is local or reusable.
2. Resolve spell identity:
   - treat kebab-case spell folder names as canonical IDs,
   - search the library spell registry and local spell contracts for aliases,
   - match aliases case-insensitively,
   - return `BLOCK` if an alias maps to more than one spell,
   - record both alias used and canonical spell ID in reports.
3. Detect available sigils from the library and any local sigil folders.
4. Inspect existing repository harnesses when relevant:
   - `.arcanum/inventory/`,
   - `.arcanum/observability/`,
   - `.arcanum/spells/`,
   - architecture packages,
   - context packs,
   - decision records,
   - local docs or wiki folders.
5. If designing a spell, identify:
   - workflow goal,
   - trigger conditions,
   - required sigils,
   - optional sigils,
   - prerequisites,
   - shared state,
   - handoff artifacts,
   - gates,
   - failure policy,
   - observability needs.
6. If the source is an Invoke handoff, record the handoff path and preserve Invoke's decisions, gaps, and target-artifact provenance without treating Invoke as the lifecycle owner.
7. If designing a reusable spell, initialize or preserve an experiment harness through `experiment-harness`:
   - create `development/VALIDATION-EXPERIMENT.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, fixtures, and runner scripts,
   - use `--profile spellcraft` when validating the Spellcraft lifecycle around a target spell,
   - add low, medium, and complex examples when the spell has reusable modes or phases,
   - keep live Codex CLI execution explicit and bounded.
8. When implementation tasks are executed through Task Session or Codex Goal, require the runtime evidence shape and route reusable-behavior proof through Experiment Harness before promotion readiness.
9. If installing a library spell, adapt only local paths, thresholds, interaction mode, aliases, and gate strictness. Do not rewrite upstream sigil contracts.
10. If validating, check:
   - referenced sigils exist or are declared local/external,
   - aliases resolve to exactly one canonical spell,
   - every phase has input, output, gate, and failure policy,
   - handoff artifacts are named,
   - spell does not copy full sigil instructions,
   - experiment harness evidence exists when the spell is expected to be reused,
   - observability is defined when the spell is expected to be reused.
11. If observing, record spell-level telemetry using the repository observability package when available.
12. If reflecting, review accumulated spell telemetry and propose targeted changes while preserving the spell's core purpose.
13. Return the spell file path, validation state, canonical ID, alias used, and next recommended action.
</process>

<spell-contract>
Every spell must define:

- canonical ID,
- aliases, when any,
- purpose,
- trigger conditions,
- required sigils,
- optional sigils,
- prerequisites,
- shared state,
- execution phases,
- handoff artifacts,
- gates,
- failure policy,
- local customization,
- observability,
- output contract.
</spell-contract>

<authority-rule>
A spell may compose sigils, but it must not redefine the internal contract of a referenced sigil. If a sigil contract needs to change, route that work through the sigil's own maintenance workflow.
</authority-rule>

<observability>
When `.arcanum/observability/` exists, record:

- spell name,
- mode,
- phases attempted,
- sigils invoked,
- gates passed,
- gates blocked,
- handoff failures,
- outputs produced,
- validation result,
- user corrections,
- recommended spell updates.
</observability>

<quality-bar>
A successful execution must:

- keep spells distinct from sigil tiers,
- resolve aliases to stable canonical IDs,
- reference sigils rather than copying their process bodies,
- define phase inputs, outputs, gates, and failure policy,
- preserve local customization without forking upstream sigils,
- validate referenced sigils and handoff artifacts,
- define or preserve an experiment harness for reusable spells,
- treat Codex Goal evidence as SWU execution evidence, not as reusable-behavior validation,
- require experiment harness evidence or a named block before promotion readiness,
- define observability for reusable spells,
- return a clear next action.
</quality-bar>

<anti-patterns>
Avoid:

- treating spells as a fourth sigil tier,
- allowing one alias to resolve to multiple active spells,
- hiding multiple unrelated workflows in one spell,
- copying full sigil instructions into a spell file,
- installing a library spell without adapting local paths,
- running later phases after an earlier gate blocks,
- letting a spell mutate a sigil contract without explicit maintenance work,
- omitting failure policy for handoff gaps.
</anti-patterns>

<output-contract>
Return:

```markdown
